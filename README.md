# RentMate
Split up rent and utility costs!

I'm trying to get some experience with web development, and since I'm sharing an apartment with friends next year I figured
it might be fun to make a website that splits up rent and utility costs.  I know there are sites like www.spliddit.org
that use really fancy algorithms to keep everyone happy, and if you're having serious problems with your roommates you might want
to give them a look.  RentMate is not designed to be a revolutionary tool for getting everyone to pay their landlords on time - 
it's more of a personal project, just me trying to get started with Bootstrap and jQuery.  However, I'd be delighted if you tried it
out!
